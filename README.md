# growbox
This will be the code for my diploma thesis. I'm building my own growbox with my friends.

# description
For this project I will use a Raspberry Pi 3. The programming language is Elixir. For more informations about Elixir, you can visit the homepage. https://elixir-lang.org/.

In our growbox are a few sensors to get temperature, water levels and quality and flow rate. The inputs can be seen on a website, which is also running on the Pi. A camera will take photos and make a time-lapse video. In total we will have four pumps. Three of them will be in small tanks with water, nutrient solution and a liquid to bring down the pH value of the water in the larger tank. In the larger tank all liquids are mixed together and the fourth pump will water the plants with it.

To read all these sensors and control the pumps I will design my own Raspberry Pi Header. I'll design it with the software EAGLE from autodesk. On the board will be three current sources, an ADC, a circuit to control a relais and several clamps.
